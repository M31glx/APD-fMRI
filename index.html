  <h1>Project: Functional MRI study of children diagnosed with APD</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This study explores brain network organization in children with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) using resting-state fMRI data and graph theory approaches. Key findings include differences in brain hub architecture and functional connectivity between children with APD and healthy controls, particularly in regions related to auditory processing.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) leads to difficulties in understanding speech despite normal hearing. The origins of APD symptoms are debated, with limited knowledge on the role of altered brain network topology.</p>
  <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> To investigate the functional brain network organization in children with APD and compare it with healthy controls using advanced neuroimaging techniques and network science approaches.</p>

  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <h3>Population for collecting multi-modal data</h3>
  <p>66 children (57 included) aged 8-14 years old (28 with diagnosis of APD and 29 healthy controls).</p>

  <h3>Data type</h3>
  <p>Functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data acquired by multi-echo multi-band imaging sequences.</p>

  <h3>Analysis Techniques</h3>
  <p>Complex network analysis using graph theory, focusing on global and nodal network properties, and brain hub architecture.</p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>The findings suggest that children with APD have distinct alterations in brain network topology, particularly in regions associated with auditory processing.

  <p>This study contributes to the understanding of brain network alterations in APD, with potential implications for developing targeted interventions.</p>

  <h2>Funding</h2>
  <p>This study was funded by <a href="https://www.emcentre.ac.nz/">Eisdell Moore Centre</a> and the Faculty of Science's Research fund from <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">the University of Auckland</a>.</p>


  <h2>Data science behind the study</h2>
  <p>In this project, a range of different approaches were used to treat the data, such as formatting 4D imaging dataset (DICOM --> NIFTI), re-arranging data structure into brain Imaging Data structure (BIDS), quality inspection for evaluating spurious data (MRIQC), evaluation of de-noising pipelines, and modeling data based on the theory of graphs and statistical analysis.</p>

  <h3>fMRI data</h3>
  <p>When acquiring functional MRI (fMRI) data from a scanner, the output includes a complex array of raw and processed data that captures both structural and functional aspects of the brain.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Raw fMRI Data (DICOM Files)</h3>
  <p>The raw data from the MRI scanner is typically stored in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. Each DICOM file contains a 2D slice of the brain, along with metadata (e.g., patient information, acquisition parameters like slice thickness, and time of acquisition).</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Data Organization steps</h3>
  <p>NIfTI Format: The raw DICOM files are often converted into a more standardized format, such as the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format.</p>

<h3>Computer Vision</h3>

<h4>1. Data Quality (QC)</h4>
<p>In order to assess the quality of each data for pre-processing, first each NIFTI data was visualized and evaluated against their quality control (QC) parameters such as FD (a measurement of how much the head moves from one frame to the next), DIVARS (derivatives of FD), etc., as well as their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-86402-z#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Ccarpet%20plot%E2%80%9D%20is%20a,of%20neuronal%20and%20physiological%20activity.">carpet plot</a> (2-dimensional plot of scaled fMRI voxel intensity values).</p>

<p>This pipeline is written in Bash and utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/nipreps/mriqc/tree/master">MRIQC</a> (Python tool) for data quality assessment.</p>

  <p>Figure 5: Visualized NIFTI data according to its quality measures.</p>
</div>

<h4>2. Image pre-processing</h4>
<p>After discarding data points that did not meet the QC requirement, the remaining data were processed using sequences of cleaning procedures such as image transformations, head motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing. This procedure utilizes <a href="https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/">fMRIPrep</a>, the neuroimaging standard pipeline for minimal image cleaning.</p>

  <p>Figure 6: Some of the fMRI image pre-processing steps.</p>
</div>

<h4>3. Selection of optimal de-noising pipelines</h4>
<p>After minimal processing, each data point underwent further cleaning procedures to remove motion and confound signals from the fMRI signal (<a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bold-imaging">BOLD signal</a>). Multiple existing de-noising pipelines were tested against efficiency and efficacy indices for accuracy performance. For example, Figure 7 highlights the highest score of ICA-AROMA+8Phs+4GSR (High QC-FC, Low QC-FC dependence) among the most popular de-noising pipelines for the project's fMRI dataset.</p>

<h2>Modeling the fMRI data</h2>

<h3>Complex network analysis</h3>
<p>Various complex network analysis methods were applied to the data to understand brain connectivity patterns, focusing on both global and local network properties.</p>

<h3>Constructing network model</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Defining data points: Each region of interest (ROI) was represented as a node in the brain network.</li>
  <li>Defining connections: Functional connectivity between ROIs was computed and represented as edges in the network.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Processing the data (Application of graph theory algorithms)</h2>

<h3>Global and local topology evaluation</h3>
<p>Global and local network properties such as efficiency, clustering coefficient, and modularity were calculated to understand the brain’s network topology in children with APD.</p>

<h3>Backbone consistency tests (Hub model)</h3>
<p>Brain hubs, or highly connected regions, were identified and tested for consistency across subjects.</p>

<h3>Connection consistency test</h3>
<p>The stability and consistency of network connections were evaluated across APD and control groups.</p>

<h2>Statistical evaluation</h2>

<h3>Multivariate tests</h3>
<p>Multivariate statistical analyses were performed to assess differences between APD and control groups in terms of global and local network properties.</p>

<h3>Correlation tests</h3>
<p>Correlation tests were applied to examine the relationships between network metrics and behavioral performance in auditory perception tasks.</p>
