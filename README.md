# Altered Brain Network Topology in Children with Auditory Processing Disorder

## Introduction
This study explores brain network organization in children with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) using resting-state fMRI data and graph theory approaches. Key findings include differences in brain hub architecture and functional connectivity between children with APD and healthy controls, particularly in regions related to auditory processing.

## Background
**Problem Statement:** Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) leads to difficulties in understanding speech despite normal hearing. The origins of APD symptoms are debated, with limited knowledge on the role of altered brain network topology.

**Objectives:** To investigate the functional brain network organization in children with APD and compare it with healthy controls using advanced neuroimaging techniques and network science approaches.

### Population for collecting multimodal data
- 66 children (57 included)  aged 8-14 years old (28 with diagnosis of APD and 29 healthy controls).

### Data type
- functional MRI (rsfMRI) data using a multi-echo multiband sequences

### Analysis Techniques
- Complex network analysis using graph theory, focusing on global and nodal network properties, and brain hub architecture.

## Results

### Global Network Properties
- Both APD and control groups showed similar global network properties, but differences emerged in hub architecture.

### Key Findings
- Decreased participation coefficient in auditory cortical regions in children with APD, suggesting altered functional connectivity in specific brain networks.
- Positive correlation between left parahippocampal gyrus connectivity and auditory perception tasks in children with APD.

## Discussion
The findings suggest that children with APD have distinct alterations in brain network topology, particularly in regions associated with auditory processing. These results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying APD and highlight the potential for using advanced neuroimaging and network science approaches to further our understanding of auditory processing disorders.

## Conclusion
This study contributes to the understanding of brain network alterations in APD, with potential implications for developing targeted interventions.
