classdef ProgressBar < handle
    %PROGRESSBAR Progress bar class for matlab loops which also works with parfor.
    %   PROGRESSBAR works by creating a file called progressbar_(random_number).txt in
    %   your working directory, and then keeping track of the loop's
    %   progress within that file. This workaround is necessary because parfor
    %   workers cannot communicate with one another so there is no simple way
    %   to know which iterations have finished and which haven't.
    %
    % METHODS:  ProgressBar(num); constructs an object and initializes the progress monitor 
    %                             for a set of N upcoming calculations.
    %           progress(); updates the progress inside your loop and
    %                       displays an updated progress bar.
    %           stop(); deletes progressbar_(random_number).txt and finalizes the 
    %                   progress bar.
    %
    % EXAMPLE: 
    %           N = 100;
    %           p = ProgressBar(N);
    %           parfor i=1:N
    %              pause(rand); % Replace with real code
    %              p.progress; % Also percent = p.progress;
    %           end
    %           p.stop; % Also percent = p.stop;
    %
    % To suppress output call constructor with optional parameter 'verbose':
    %       p = ProgressBar(N,'verbose',0);
    %
    % To get percentage numbers from progress and stop methods call them like:
    %       percent = p.progress;
    %       percent = p.stop;
